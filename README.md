# Initial System Structure

The system will be divided into the following technical components:

   - Implemented using **Spring Boot** as a **RESTful API** backend to handle authentication, category and reflection management, report generation, and communication with the GenAI service.

- **Client**
   - Built using **React** with **Vite** for fast development and bundling.
   - Styled using **Tailwind CSS**.
   - UI components will be provided by **shadcn/ui** for a modern and accessible interface.

- **GenAI Service**
   - A separate microservice written in **Python**, utilizing **LangChain** to provide personalized AI feedback and empathetic conversational interactions.

- **Database**
   - **PostgreSQL** will be used for persistent storage of user accounts, categories, reflections, and generated reports.

- **Containerization**
   - All components will be containerized using **Docker** to ensure consistency across development, testing, and deployment environments.
