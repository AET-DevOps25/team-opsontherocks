## Initial Product Backlog

- **User Authentication**
   - As a user, I want to log in and log out of my account, so I can have access to stored data.

- **Life Category Management**
   - As a user, I want to add new and remove existing life categories, so my wheel of life reflects what truly matters in my life.

- **Weekly Reflection Logging**
   - As a user, I want to create weekly reflections by rating my life categories from 1-10 and adding a reflective note, so I can reflect and have visual evaluation of my week in a structured and visual way.

- **Personalized AI Feedback**
   - As a user, I want to receive improvement or encouragement as personalized AI feedback report, so I can have a more balanced fulfilling life.

# Initial System Structure

The system will be divided into the following technical components:

- **Server**
   - Implemented using **Spring Boot** as a **RESTful API** backend to handle authentication, category and reflection management, report generation, and communication with the GenAI service.

- **Client**
   - Built using **React** with **Vite** for fast development and bundling.
   - Styled using **Tailwind CSS**.
   - UI components will be provided by **shadcn/ui** for a modern and accessible interface.

- **GenAI Service**
   - A separate microservice written in **Python**, utilizing **LangChain** to provide personalized AI feedback and empathetic conversational interactions.

- **Database**
   - **PostgreSQL** will be used for persistent storage of user accounts, categories, reflections, and generated reports.

- **Containerization**
   - All components will be containerized using **Docker** to ensure consistency across development, testing, and deployment environments.


# Diagrams

![Use Case Diagram](/docs/UseCaseDiagram.png)
Use Case Diagram

A user logs into their account and fills out a weekly reflection. This includes rating their selected life categories (on a scale from 1 to 10) and optionally adding a note about their week. Once they submit the reflection, they receive personalized feedback based on what they wrote and past reflections if available.

The user can also start a chat with an assistant to get further support or guidance. The assistant uses current and previous reflections to provide relevant and meaningful replies.

In addition, users can manage their life categories, adding new ones or removing the ones that no longer apply. They can also view their progress over time through reports and charts, helping them understand trends in different areas of their life.



![Component Diagram](/docs/ComponentDiagram.png)
Component Diagram

The system consists of four main parts: the server, the client, the GenAI service, and the database.
The server contains an authentication service that is used by the user repository and the LoginUI to handle user authentication and access control. 
It also includes a progress service, which manages past reflections and is used by the reflection repository and the ProgressUI. 
The reflection service handles creating and updating weekly reflections and is used by the reflection repository, the ReflectionUI, and the ReportUI. 
The GenAI service includes an AI feedback service, which is used by the AI feedback repository, the ReportUI, and the AIChatUI to provide personalized feedback. 
It also includes an AI chat service that is used by the AIChatUI to support interactive conversations. 
The client consists of all user interfaces including LoginUI, ReflectionUI, ProgressUI, ReportUI, and AIChatUI, which interact with both the server and the GenAI service. 
The database stores all application data including users, reflections, categories, and feedback, and is accessed through the user repository, reflection repository, and AI feedback repository.


![Analysis Object Model](/docs/AnalysisObjectModel.png)
Analysis Object Model
Each user has their own set of life categories, which they can customize to match what's important to them. They use these categories to rate their week during the reflection process.

The reflection includes those ratings and an optional note. Each reflection is tied to the user and stored in the system.

After a reflection is submitted, a feedback report is created using the GenAI service. This report is based on both the current reflection and past data, if there is any.

Users also have a dashboard that shows progress over time. This is generated by looking at past reflections and displaying charts or stats.

Categories are grouped under main types like Career, Health, Relationships, and Other. Users can create or remove subcategories to personalize their experience.
