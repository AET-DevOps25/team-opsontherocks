      > ‚ÄúFeeling a bit lonely, haven‚Äôt seen my friends for two weeks and feel a little overworked.‚Äù

3. **AI-Generated Feedback**
   > ‚ÄúBased on your report, you‚Äôve been feeling a bit lonely and mentioned feeling a little overworked.  
   > Similar to previous weeks, your finances are stable, which is a great foundation and something you can feel proud of ‚Äî it shows you‚Äôve been handling your responsibilities well.
   >
   > Here are a few small, positive steps you might try this week:
   > - üí¨ Send a short message to a friend you haven‚Äôt talked to in a while, just to check in and see how they‚Äôre doing.
   > - ü§ù Try to meet up with a friend this weekend, or look for an interesting event or even visit a local park to meet new people.
   > - üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Add light exercise like a daily walk or some stretching ‚Äî it‚Äôs great for boosting both mood and energy.
   > - üí§ Take short breaks during your workday to help recharge and ease the sense of being overworked.
   >
   > You‚Äôre already making progress, and these small steps can help things feel even better. Would you like more suggestions or have any other questions?‚Äù

4. **Ongoing Reflection**
    - User chats with the AI for further guidance.
    - Over time, reviews trend visualizations to see improvements.
